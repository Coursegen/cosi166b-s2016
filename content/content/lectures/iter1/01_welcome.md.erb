<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. Locate and continue going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). You will be responsible for lesson 1-44 over the next week and a half. You will then have to do and submit lesson 45 as homework.

* Study the requirements for the first programming assignment: <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. You will be using what you've learned about programming in your previous courses. Yes, it's a new langauge, but really the basic ideas are exactly the same. We are working on problem solvingn as much as anything. Come ready to discuss the approach you will take in class.

#### Welcome

* Introduce Pito, where I came from, and why I am excitied about this course.
* Look at: <%= link_to_topic :pitofaq %>
* Here are the <%= link_to_topic :books_cosi166 %>
* Here are the <%= link_to_topic :goals_cosi166 %>
* Let's take a tour of the web site
* Let's take a tour of Latte for this course
* The prime source for this course is this web site itself!

#### Discuss Pre-work
* What's cool about Ruby? What don't you like?
* How far did you get in the pre-work?

#### If you weren't able to register
* Some people will drop so room will likely open up
* Come to all the classes, and do all the work
* Submit homeworks via email to the TAs

#### Homeworks and Grading
* The prime source for this course is this web site.
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
* There you will find the list of homeworks due for the class
* Latte is used **just** as a way to submit homeworks

<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>
* Let's look at the <%= link_to_background :grading %>
* Yes there is a fair bit of homework
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
* Some homeworks have explicit deliverables:
  * Explicit deliverables are noted as follows: "<%= deliverable "You gotta do this" %>"
  * Team deliverables are noted as follows: <%= team_deliverable "One submission for your team" %>
  * If there is no Explicit deliverable, you can assume that it will be discussed in class and you will be called on.
  * Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
* The portfolio
  * Where all your programming work has to happen
  * Look carefully at <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
  * Your portfolio will be formally reviewed every week for progress

##### Homework Hygiene

* Often there is a explicit deliverable, a blog post, a zip file with code, etc. They may not be graded if you don't adhere to the following:
1. Those have to be submitted to LATTE
1. They MUST include your name and the homework number

#### 20 Minute Quick Assignment
* <%= ir("check here on day 1 of class") %>

#### Projects

* Projects are at the core of this course!
* We will form teams of exactly four students. Teams will be formed in collaboration between me and the students.
* Let's look at what it's like to <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %>
* Each team will work together to choose a project from our list of: <%= link_to_incubator :prod_candidates %>

#### Skills Inventory
* **Whether you are officially registered or want to be on the wait list**
* *Really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mKzR9kt_1DGD_zK5--sKNnBh1x3e8WEA0I2o9JU-BCw/viewform#start=openform). (This page is protected until the day of class) Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**

#### Programming Assignments
* Review exactly what <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> is about. Answer questions.

#### Next Class
* Let's review: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
