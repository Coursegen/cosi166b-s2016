title: (LAB) Ruby Practice
desc: Hands on with Ruby / Team Selection
homework: Read AWDR Chapter 1 and 4
---
<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read "Agile Web Development with Rails" \[AWDR\] Chapters 1 AND 4. Ch1 Reviews the installation of Ruby and of Rails, and Ch4 Reviews Ruby. It should come very easy given the work you've done so far. Still there is good stuff to learn there, so don't cut corners! <%= deliverable "Do the warmup in Latte and submit by 8am on the day of class." %>


<%= callout("DO NOT", " Don't install RVM. You don't need it and it will make your life difficult.") %>

  * Instead install rbenv, which is far simpler and does the same: [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). Ask for help if you need it.
  * You need a simple text editor. If you don't have one, I recommend [Atom ](http://atom.io)
