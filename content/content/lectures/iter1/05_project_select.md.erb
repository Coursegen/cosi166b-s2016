* Meet outside of class for 1 hour with 3 other students, look through and discuss the project options. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea.
* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 45. You will learn about the wonders of arrays and hashes. Also one of the more advanced ruby features, modules. And now you start getting into somewhat more abstract stuff, object oriented analysis and design.. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* You have to complete link_to_topic <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> by today. If you are stuck, ask one of our wonderful TAs for assistance. Up to now you have been coding inside your own <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>
