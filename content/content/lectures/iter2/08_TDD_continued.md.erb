desc: We actually continue on TDD from the previous class
---
<%= homework_hdr %>
* Introduce testability to your product
  * Read up about the rails-admin gem and install it into your team product.
  * Every individual member of each product team writes at least 3 Minitest-spec tests for the product
  * <%= team_deliverable "Commit latest version of your product to github" %>
  * <%= deliverable "Source file with the tests that you wrote in the product" %>
* Introduce authentication to your product
  * Read \[AWDRR\] Chapter 14. This homework asks you to apply all the techniques from that chapter to your product. I have indicated how the work might be divided up. If you finish with 'your' part early you need to offer to help the other team members. I suggest that you all work around a table on your sections so you can ask questions etc. Check code into github regularly to allow sharing of the latest.
  * **Do not use the Devise gem unless you really really want to (suffer)**
  * Decide with your team:
    * What can an admin user do and not do
    * What can a regular user do and not do
    * What can someone who is not logged in do and not do
  * Team member 1: 
    * Create a User model along the same lines as the chapter. Also their controller and view and to allow users to be managed
    * Write a test that verifies that a non-logged in user can access "protected parts" of your app
  * Team member 2: 
    * Create and implement the Sessions controller, along the same line as the chapter
    * Add the necessary routes for sessions
    * Write the tests for the new controller
  * Team member 3:
    * Implement the "authorization" part of the Chapter: "Limiting Access" etc
    * Also write the tests for that part
  * Team member 4:
    * Implement logic and test to make sure last admin doesn't get deleted
  * <%= team_deliverable "link to your github account; a screencapture demonstrating that what you implemented works and that tests run." %> (how to do a <%= link_to_topic :screencast %>)
