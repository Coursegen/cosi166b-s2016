* Read several of these articles:
  * [Effective Use of white space in forms](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space).
  * [Clean Up Your Visual Mess](http://www.visualmess.com)
  * [A Summary of User Interface Design Principles](http://www.sylvantech.com/~talin/projects/ui_design.html)
  * [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/).
* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. Let's call that the SDV - Showcase Day Version (see <%= link_to_topic :product_plan_of_attack %>) - <%= team_deliverable "A detailed paper prototype of the SDV of your product, applying the principles you learned about in the readings above. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work. Use actual paper or, better, balsamiq.com" %>

#### Project Teams midcourse progress review!
This is not actually homework but a chance to catch up if you need it. This afternoon after class the TAs and I will review your progress on your product up to now. This will count as 10% of the 35% of your grade for the product. The other 25% will come through based on your work from now forward. Assessment scores will be based on:

1. progress on completing the steps of the roadmap
1. quality of the code so far
1. degree of challenge of the product plan
1. thoughtfulness of stories, with respect to SDV
1. probability of success
1. preparation for PR meetings (as reported by PRs)
1. informal feedback from the PRs
1. TA advisors assessment of teams progress
1. indidividuals contribution to team success

#### Discussion
* Feedback about project progress so far:
	* Many teams have problems with their basic schemas
	* Many teams are not taking advantage of available help
	* Remember to think about your SDV (Showcase Day Version)
	* In the next few weeks we will be having self and peer reviews of projects
* Homework
	* What did you think of the various articles and papers? Interesting?
	* Some simple lessons you learned about UI
	* Did you use balsamiq? 
	* Let's look at some of the mockups and discuss them

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience. 
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
