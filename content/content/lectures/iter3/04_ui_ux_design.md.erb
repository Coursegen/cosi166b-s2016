* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. Let's call that the SDV - Showcase Day Version (see <%= link_to_section :incubator, :product_plan_of_attack %>) - <%= team_deliverable "A detailed paper prototype of the SDV of your product, applying the principles you learned about in the readings above. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work. Use actual paper or, better, balsamiq.com" %>
* **Teams:** Each team writes up a report of their work so far. It should be 2-3 pages covering progress to date. It should include these kinds of topics:
1. progress on completing the steps of the roadmap
1. current set of stories, in priority order, which are the target of the SDV
1. up to date set of designs on paper or in balsamiq
<%= team_deliverable "Submit the report as a pdf" %>

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
