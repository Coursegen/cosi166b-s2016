* Each team needs to really prepare! You will have 5-10 minutes to show these two things only:
	1. Your list of 'loose ends' or 'open issues'. Several of the Product Reviers said that you teams did not have a good list of loose ends. I've explained this several times. These are details that are needed for the Product Showcase Demo.
