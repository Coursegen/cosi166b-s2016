#### Paper Prototyping
* There are many media for doing this.
	* See lots of examples of [paper prototyping here](http://www.google.com/search?q=paper+prototyping&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&prmd=imvnsb&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=slDNT5TgBIW16AHc293MAg&ved=0CGYQsAQ&biw=1251&bih=840)
	* An interesting article: [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/)
	* Another interesting article: [Test Paper Prototypes to Save Time and Money: The Mozilla Case Study](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/mozilla-paper-prototype/?utm_source=Alertbox&utm_campaign=76128ff738-Paper_Ptype_Touch_Screen_Readers_1045_08_31_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_7f29a2b335-76128ff738-40070533)
* Advantages
	* Very cheap which saves money
	* But also makes it less painful when it has to be changed totally
	* Allows a user to take over and cross things out and suggest other ideas
* You can take this as far as you want.
	* Smaller snippets for the various ui widgets (e.g. drop down menus)
	* Make a "screen flow diagram" by connecting the different sheets of paper with lines showing the transitions
	* It is similar to a movie 'storyboard'

##### Here is my example: not good UI.

* Why I insist on 'paper prototyping'
* How ugly can it be?
* Fast iteration
