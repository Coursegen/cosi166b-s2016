title: Cosi 105 Final Deliverables
---

#### Final Deliverables

1. Team nanoTwitter deliverables
	* nanoTwitter Github Repo
	* nanoTwitter Scalability Tests
	* nanoTwitter Portfolio page

* Due on "day of the final"

#### How nanoTwitter will be evaluated

* Quality of the engineering.
	* How is the design, is it broken down into some classes?
	* Is there attention to single responsibility principle and other good design practices?
	* Are the classes and methods reasonably brief. How does the code look?
	* Are there tests and are they being run automatically?
* Quality of the Scalability.
	* How well does the nT perform under load from loader.io using the specific testing rules that we described.
	* What steps did you take to help it scale better?
	* And what is final result?
* Fit and Finish.
	* Does the final product look professional and clean? Did you read the requirements (from me) broadly and go beyond the very minimum? Or did you just barely get it to work? Does it look good and show pride of work?
* Github
	* You will be submitting the github directory with the code in it
	* Include a readme file that documents your design as far as you need to.
	* Make sure to include a "CodeClimate" badge in your readme.

#### How nanoTwitter Scalability will be tested
* We will be looking at how well your server stands the load
* There is not a magic number to beat
* You need to make sure that the test protocol works as defined in the section on nanoTwitter Functionality.

#### Porfolio Page
* Create a single page web site a [Github Page Site](https://pages.github.com) attached to your github directory
* Make it look pretty!
* An "e-brochure" for your project
* Containing info such as:
	* Summary statement of assignment (1-2 paragraphs)
	* Screenshots
	* Technology Description
	* Interesting Engineering
	* Result of scalability work, timings etc.
	* Team members
	* Dates
