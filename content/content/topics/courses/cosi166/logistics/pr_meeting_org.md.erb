title: PR Meeting Preparation
---
#### Preparation
* You are the hosts. I will be teaching
* Don't make the invited guests wait!
* Decide between the teams the order of the meetings
* This is a review meeting not a presentation or pitch
* Team should decide how the meeting is run 
* Make notes and especially action items from PR
* Think through Meeting agenda
  * What do you want to present?
  * What questions and advice you would like from your reviewer?

#### Things to bring to the meeting
* Whatever the PR has asked you to prepare (if anything.)
* New and improved one page summary of the product
* Your github repo with what you have so far
  * Should have at least SOME unit tests
  * Should have the full schema represented
  * You should have it deployed to Heroku
* Final diagram of db schema
  * Make sure one of youcan explain it and answer any and all questions about it.
  * Use any format or tool you like
* Paper Prototype
  * Include multiple single screens
  * Include a UX Flow map
* Trello list of stories, prioritized

#### Running the meeting
* Look at this as a "product review meeting" you might have with the CEO or CTO of your company. See also [BillG Review](http://wmworia.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/bill-g-review/)
* The meeting will go around 45 minutes. Make the most of it.
* The team should lead the discussion to decide what to cover next.
* It's kind of like when you go to the doctor, they ask you, "So what brings you here." You decide how to use the time.
