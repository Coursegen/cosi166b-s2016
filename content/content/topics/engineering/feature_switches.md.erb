#### Feature Switches
* A direct result of engaging in continuous integration
* How it works:
  * Usually the toggling happens in the UI.
  * Defines a sybol list of features that you may want to hide, e.g. "petSurvey", "profileUpload", "FacebookIntegration"
  * And then "guard" the corresponding html, making sure user cannot get to that feature
  * Site Administrator is able to turn on and off features without re-deploying
<%= code_begin %>
    <toggle name="petSurvey">
      <p>Take our new <a href = 'petSurvey'>pet survey</a></p>
    </toggle>
<%= code_end %>
* Reasons
  * Hide a feature that is not done yet
  * Hide a feature that you discovered is broken
  * Hide a feature that is killing performance
  * Split testing
