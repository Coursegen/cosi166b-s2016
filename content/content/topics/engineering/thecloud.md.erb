title: "The Cloud"
---

#### Taxonomy of "The Cloud"
* Software as a Service **(SaaS)**: Delivers an application through a web site or app.
  * Examples: Google Docs, Basecamp, Github, etc.
  * Differentiated by what the app is
* Platform as a Service **(Paas)**: Deploy your apps to the cloud, based on their platform.
  * Examples: Heroku, [Amazon Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), Google App Engine, Pusher.com
  * Differentiated by what the platform is, e.g. Node.js, Rails, Go, etc.
* Infrastructure as a Service **(IaaS)**: Delivers some part of infrastructure through the cloud. Infrastructure might be CPU, Disk, Queueing service etc.
  * Examples: Amazon EC2, S3, Google Compute Engine, Linode, etc.
  * Differentiated by what part(s) of infrastructure are offered.
* DIY Clouds
  * Open Source Project: [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/learn/features/)
  * DEIS (nothing to do with Brandeis :) [DEIS](http://deis.io)
* Pricing
  * These services usually have a free tier, but for 'serious' use you need to pay
  * Some examples:
    * Heroku: free for 'open source' (which I think means Public Github Repos)
    * Pusher: free for up to 20 simultanuous connections. (what is the lifecycle of a connection?)
    * S3 (AWS Storage Server): 5 GB of Amazon S3 standard storage free (see further details on their site.)
    * CodeClimate: Free for public repos
    * Github: Free for public Repos
    * loader.io: Simulated load to test scalability
* Notice that the terms are not settled yet. XaaS sometimes is defined differently

#### Products: Web vs. Cloud Architecture
* <%= discussion "Is there a difference? What are some of the tradeoffs?" %>
* A lot in common
	* Accessed using HTTP/REST protocols (typically)
	* Accessed with a web browser or mobile app (typically)
* What does the term "provisioning" mean?
* Overview of deployment
	* Web: means you own, or control, and manage, a complete set of servers for your application
	* Cloud: means you rent nodes in a cloud (e.g. Amazon Web Services)
	* What are web services?
* Big differences
	* "Elasticity"
	* "API control over provisioning"
