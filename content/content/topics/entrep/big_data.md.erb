#### Target Stores
* Problem:
	* Get customers to do all their shopping at Target
	* People shop for different things in different places
	* However new parents have no time to shop and can be convinced
	* Birth records are public. Baraged with promotion at that point.
	* Goal: find out and start marketing before baby is born!
* Statistical analysis detected among shoppers who had signed up for the "Baby Register" bought:
	* More lotion
	* More calcium supplements
	* More cotton balls and soap
	* etc.
	* So: Begin marketing to them early. However: Unintended side effects

#### What is "Big Data"
* As usual, a new term has many varied definitions
* Huge amounts of data being collected because of advances in technology
	* Online transactions
	* Electronic Records
	* Online behavior
	* Instrumentation and automatic intake
* Advances in Computation and Statistics
	* Process the data in real time 
	* New kinds of databases (beyond tabular "SQL" databases)
* Sources of the big data
	* Science (Genomics, Weather, ...)
	* Business (Amazon, Google, ...)
	* Government (Medicare, Obamacare, ...)

#### Key Technology Trends
* Databases: Column databases, No SQL Databases
* MapReduce: Computational architecture for mass scaling
* Cloud Computing

#### Challenges
* "Big Data Hubris" - Just because you have a lot of data
* "Bad Data" - Google Flu badly failed to predict. Search for Flu Remedy" does not mean I have flu
* "Correlation vs. Causation" - Deep statistical insight and humility required
* "Gaming the System" - Grading or student performance based on analysis of essays
