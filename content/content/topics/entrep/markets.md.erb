title: Markets and Segments
---
#### What is a 'market' in this context?
* How do you think about the market size?
* Look at segments, value proposition and market entry
* Segments: For your market or customer hypothesis, you need to understand the market(s) and segment(s) you are serving.
* Notice that these are not black and white, they can be continuums or multi-faceted.
* Types
  * Mass Market: Huge and undifferentiated. Horizontal, e.g. consumers age 12 to 18.
  * Niche: Highly specific: Vertical, e.g. Bicyclists
  * Segmented: your product serves more than one segment. Apple serves the consumer and education market segments
  * Diversified: your product serves very different markets: Amazon serves consumers and software developer
  * Two or multi-sided markets: brings two or more segments together: dating services,  newspapers
  * there are others...

#### Value Proposition:
* For each segment you need to express what value your product or service is creating.
* If you cannot express it than you probably should not be trying to address that market.
* It's not just that you are offering something 'new' to that segment. It could also be:
  * cheaper (to buy or to use)
  * faster
  * more convenient
  * better designed
  * more customized
  * brand
  * safer/less risky
  * more available (segment couldn't get it, use it, access it before)

#### Market Entry
* Existing market
  * Your customers (kind of) understand the problem and your solution
  * You have (kind of) competitors
  * Your customers will have to stop using another product
  * Sometimes your entry can grow the number of customers, sometimes you fight it out (e.g. Facebook for Seniors. Is that a new or existing market?)
  * So you can:
    * ENTER an existing market, e.g. Android joining iPhone and compete directly
    * RESEGMENT an existing market - with one of value propositions above, e.g. iPhone joining Blackberry
    * RESEGMENT a market - by going after a sub-component of it, e.g. Tesla entering automobile market

* New Market
  * Your customers may not know they have the problem
  * You have to teach/explain them why your product/service exists
  * They will have to find budget (money) to pay for it.
  * This is a very expensive process for you
  * So you can:
    * CREATE a totally new market, e.g. Palm, creating the PDA market

* Discussion: Let's see what advantages and challenges each example has
* Exercise: 
  * Company and market
    * Barnes and Nobel Nook
    * Tesla Motors
    * Olin College
    * Apple iTunes
    * Raspberry Pi
    * Nest Thermostat
    * Microsoft X-Box
    * Makerbot Replicator
    * Google Android
    * Pocket Hose (google it)
  * 5 minutes: Team up in by classroom table, pick a different product, and answer:
    * what market(s) is this company and/or product in
    * what segment and kind of segment does it compete in
    * what is it's value proposition is it offering that market
    * how did it attack or enter the market
    * additional observations and/or insights?

* Report out by table
