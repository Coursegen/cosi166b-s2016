#### Presentation Hints and tips - General

* **Tell a Story**: Each presentation needs to be self-contained, in other words, you need to make sure it tells a story with a beginning a middle and an end.

* **Here's how things are broken today**: It's often very good to start with a compelling problem statement, e.g. here's how terrible things are right now...

* **Make clear when you are done.**: Have a clear concluding slide, maybe with a summary and ideas for further enhancements. Say "Thank you. And are there any other questions?"

* **Empathize**: Remember this is the first time people see this. You need to explain and walk through Any diagrams, paper prototypes, demos and other illustrations need to be presented and explained so that the audience can understand and be engaged.

* **Practice/Rehearse**: Please practice your part of the presentation at least a couple of times with your team. Be familiar with the material so you don't umm and mumm as if you are seeing the material for the first time. Watch your pacing. Speak clearly and in complete sentences. It's not needed that everyone speak, in fact if someone is uncomfortable speaking, has a very quiet voice, or whatever, it's ok if they maybe work the demo or be there to answer questions. But whatever you decide, you need to practice!

* **Performance**: A presentation is a kind of performance. Watch your body language! Are you energetic, engaged? If you don't care, your listener will not either! Keep in mind that no one has seen this presentation before, and at least one person in the audience has never heard of your project.

* **Time keeping**: Keep to the time limit. Keep questions to the end. Work on the handoffs between the speakers to make them as smooth as possible.

* **Logistics**: Make sure your equipment works. Bring any connectors or other gadgets you will need.

* **Make your statement of the problem as compelling as you can**:  Here are a couple of examples: *"Museums have a big problem capturing the experience of their big important exhibits for posterity. The reason this is a problem is that .... We wanted to build a product that would allow a beautiful online experience of the exhibit that happened in the past that museums could use as an archive and historical record. In doing that we discovered that our idea would work well even for individual artists to display their work in a "virtual museum. Our product xxx does that by xxxx and xxx. Let us give you a demo" or "People who love doing non-solitary sports (basket ball, frisbee, running) can sometimes have a hard time finding partners for occasional game. It's a real pain when you want to go on a run or bike ride and and don't want to go alone. We looked at that and thought we could do something about it. Our product xxx is a simple xxx specifically designed for yyy and it allows ..."*

* **When you are showing or talking about something interesting, take a moment to explain it and help the listener appreciate it.**: Feel free to get a little geeky. Remember the judges are technical and will appreciate your engineering. Even though you feel rushed try to be clear. It might be the how elegantly your UI uses Ajax to be very responsive; it might be an interesting 3D color histogram which opens up certain cool possibilities.

* **Take the time to generate Seed data that looks somewhat real.** Focusing of course on the part of the product you plan to demonstrate, it makes your presentation and demo 10x more compelling if the data is real and interesting. And then when you show the product take a moment to explain what they are seeing on the screen. "Over here every tile corresponds to an assignment, and the color tells me how urgent it is. They are displayed left to right, top to bottom in order of urgency. Here you can see the name of the professor and the title of the course."

* **Make the demo a story that matches the problem and solution statement.** Demos which are just a tour of features are much less effective than those that explain a specific scenario. *"Imagine that our Professor Pito wanted to send a visitor, like you all, an email with directions on how to get from where they are parked, to where this meeting was. He told me he spent a lot of time figuring out how to write the directions. Well lets say he was using our product, here's how easy it would be. Oh and not only would you get a textual set of directions, but a link to our site with live tracking as you got here."*

* **Your portfolio page and final report are for things that don't fit in the presentation.**: I know the time for the demo and presentation is quite short. It's ok to leave out some details from there and have them in the report.
