---
##### Background
* We are going to try our hand at designing an elevator pitch for a product or service that you know well. You can also referer to <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>
* Think about who the pitch is to, because the way the pitch goes is different depending on the audience
* In general the elevator pitch should be short, and it has a goal of persuading a particular audience that they should be interested in your product and want to learn more about it
* **Remember** This is not an ad on radio or tv, it's a pitch between you and a person you are trying to influece.

##### Mission
* Break into teams and discuss the problem. Come up with the best elevator pitch for one of these products would be. While you don't want a fixed script you do want to make sure you write down all the key points or phrases to make sure you don't leave anything out.
* Meet with your sister team and compare what you came up with and then refine to produce one unified result. Prepare to deliver the pitch and also give an explanation of what you are trying to achieve with each piece of it.
