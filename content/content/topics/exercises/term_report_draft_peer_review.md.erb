---
#### Summary of this assignment
* Select another product team to be your mutual peer
* Trade your draft final project report and read it closely
* Have a discussion and constructive criticism
* Be open minded! Be honest!
* Reviewee and reviewer teams: Listen carefully and take notes
* Consider:
  1. *Effort/Seriousness of purpose.* How well is the team thinking in a Lean Startup way. Are they going to be able to develop the idea to a real business plan? Can you see the effort put into it? How well is their presentation in the actual document>
  1. *Product* How carefully is the team thinking about the product? How can their product be improved? How plausible is the concept? Try not to focus only on little details. Is there a pivot, scale up or down or any other kind of pivot?
  1. *Prospects*: How realistic is this product. Can you see an angel investor putting in $100K to fund it's initial development and prototype? How would it do on Kickstarter? Can you imagine a persuasive video for it? How would it do on Sharktank?
* Take 30 minutes; Feel free to leave the room for your meetings.

#### Deliverable

	1. A write up of how you assessed the three considerations of the other team's product.
