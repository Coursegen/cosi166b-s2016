#### Applying this to real sites

##### Let's look at these sites
* [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Lets look around it purely from a UX perspective and see what we like and don't like about. Can you see principles that it satisfies and  that it contradicts?
* [Noteflight](http://www.noteflight.com/login) - Can you or can't you assume that the user is a musician, or knows music notation?

##### Split into groups of 2
Split into groups of 2, each pick a different one from below without checking what it is. Make notes about what's good and/or bad about each one? And, specifically refer to one of the principles we have discussed
