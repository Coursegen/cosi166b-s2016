title: ERB (with Rails)
---
<%= include_topic :erb_crib %>

#### How it works with Rails
* ERBs are used primarily in views (also known as view templates in rails)
* Rails has numerous "helper" methods that work very nicely with erb
* In "routes.rb": resource or get or path or other command "automatically" defines one or more helpers. 
* In the example below, "sessions_path" was generated by the `resources :sessions` line in routes.rb
* ** Reference:** [Rails Form Helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)

##### Example
<%= code_begin %>
  <%% form_for(:sessions, url: sessions_path) do |f|  %>
      <div>
        email: <%%= f.text_field :email %>
      </div>
      <div>
        password: <%%= f.password_field :password %>
      </div>
      <%%= f.submit "Sign in" %>
  <%% end %>
<%= code_end %>
