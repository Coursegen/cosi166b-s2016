title: HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
---
#### Introduction
* Remember HTML is one of the core standards of the www: html, http, uri
* HTML is a variant of XML. Many versions. Current/latest is html5

##### Minimum Example

* General structure of all html files. They all have this.
<%= code_begin %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
<%= code_end %>

#### Tags
* Very common tags
  * `<h1>Largest header</h1>`
  * `<a href="http://www.google.com">Link tag</a>`
  * `<p>A paragraph of text</p>`
  * `<ul>A bulleted (unordered) list</ul>`
  * `<ol>A numbered (ordered) list</ol>`
  * `<li>An item in either kind of list</li>`
  * `<span>a named selection of text or other info</span>`
  * `<div>a named block of text or other in a new rectangular block</div>`
  * `<html>...</html>`
  * `<head>...</head>`
  * `<body>...</body>`
* <%= discussion "What other tags would you say are 'very common'?" %>

##### More about tags
* There are a lot lot lot of tags: [WWWSchools Tags](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/)
* Expect to look up the not so common ones. Or [Play with them online](http://cssdesk.com)
* There are many tools for 'experimenting': [Online Playgrounds for html css and js](http://designshack.net/articles/css/5-online-playgrounds-for-html-css-and-javascript-compared/)
* Like in xml, html tags can and often do have attributes

#### Most common attributes class= and id=
* In the language of xml and html, these are attributes
  * e.g. `<h1 class="chapter">Chapter 1</h1>`
  * e.g. `<div class="subchapter supplement">Supplementary</div>`
  * e.g. `<p id="error">Please check the ignition</p>`

##### *Important!*
* These don't do anything **in html**. (<<- notice I said "IN HTML")
* They just create names for elements of the page
* Names are used in other contexts: css and javascript
* They can be combined, e.g. `<p id="error urgent" class="homework">Please check the ignition</p>`

#### Links and Forms and http
* Remember the HTTP verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE (there are a few more)
* When I type a URL into the browser, it generates an HTTP GET with that URL
* When I click on a link (`<a href="http://varperrater.com/configuration/23-12-933">show config</a>`) the browser also generates an HTTP GET to that URL.
* Look at the form code below. When I press "Sign In!", it generates a "POST" to relative url `/sessions`, with two parameters with these names: "sessions\[email\]" and "sessions\[password\]"

<%= code_begin %>
<h3>Please Log In!</h3>
<form action="/sessions" method="post">
    <div>
        email:
        <input id="sessions_email" name="sessions\[email\]" type="text" />
    </div>
    <div>
        password:
        <input id="sessions_password" name="sessions\[password\]" type="password" />
    </div>
    <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Sign in" />
</form>
<%= code_end %>
