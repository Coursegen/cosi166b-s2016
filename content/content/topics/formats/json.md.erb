title: JSON (and JSON)
---

#### Introduction
* Very very similar (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1726802/what-is-the-difference-between-yaml-and-json-when-to-prefer-one-over-the-other) and [this](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572))
* JSON stands for "javascript object notation" and YAML stands for "yet another markup language"
* Used in similar applications as xml. Were born because XML was considered too verbose or rich for many more limited applications. Json is much better known at this point.

#### Example

<%= code_begin %>
"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  } 
}
<%= code_end %>

The same text expressed as XML:

<%= code_begin %>
<menu id="file" value="File">
  <popup>
    <menuitem value="New" onclick="CreateNewDoc()" />
    <menuitem value="Open" onclick="OpenDoc()" />
    <menuitem value="Close" onclick="CloseDoc()" />
  </popup>
</menu>
<%= code_end %>
