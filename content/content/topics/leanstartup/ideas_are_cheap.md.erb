* Everyone has a million ideas
  * Few know how to turn the idea into a successful product or service
  * <%= discussion "What is your definition of 'successful?'" %>

  * Keeping it secret usually only provides an  imaginary competitive advantage
* Good article: [Inventor who gave his idea away](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20130412/09091522689/heres-another-inventor-who-willingly-gave-his-greatest-idea-away-order-to-establish-it-as-global-standard.shtml)
