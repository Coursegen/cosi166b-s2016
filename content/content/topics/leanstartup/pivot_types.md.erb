title: Types of Pivots
---
* Why do we do a pivot? What are the signs that one should be contemplated?
* When is it a pivot vs. a simple change to try to respond to feedback?
	* When it's a change to a 'core assumption' ?
	* When it's a change to a 'article of faith' assumption?
* Depending on the reason of the pivot, you will consider ways in which to change plans

#### Categories of Pivot
* **Zoom in pivot** - Subset of product is what matters
* **Zoom out pivot** - Product is too narrow - generalize it
* **Customer Segment pivot** - Product solves a real problem, but there's a different market that needs it more
* **Customer need pivot** - Market we are looking at has very strong needs, but the problem we are solving is not the biggest need
* **Platform pivot** - Go from point product to a platform or vice versa
* **Technology pivot** - Change core technology
* **Channel pivot** - Change how you get the product to the customer, or change from a product to a service
* **Value Capture pivot** - A basic change in the business model or how the business is financed.
