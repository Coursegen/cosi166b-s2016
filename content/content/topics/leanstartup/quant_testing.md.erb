* "Prove" or "Disprove" a customer, problem or solution hypothesis
* Hypothesis should be well stated!
* It should be ["falsifiable"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)

#### Key Techniques

1. Person to person conversations
1. Mailing lists, facebook friends, etc.
1. Build a Landing Page
1. A/B Testing

#### Building a landing page
* What is a Landing Page and how does it fit in here? Why called that?
* Let's look at examples:
  * [Example Landing Pages](https://onepagelove.com/gallery/landing-page)
  * See [More examples on Unbounce](http://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/built-using-unbounce/landing-page-designs/)

* Tips for when you build a landing page for your product:
  * What hypotheses (plural) are you testing?
  * Get your most artistic team member to do the design
  * Choose the words very carefully
  * How are you going to get it distributed widely?
* Tools: [Instapage](https://instapage.com/) and [Landingi](http://landingi.com/)
* A/B Testing
	* Also known as "split testing"
	* Divide your targets into two (or more sets)
	* Show each of them an alternative version
	* Works best with a feature description, a marketing message, a price and so on.
	* <%= discussion "For each product team, what are some things that you could test using A/B? Exactly how would you go about it?" %>

#### Online Survey
* Designing a good online survey
* Don't flood university community with surveys, especially non-students
* How many questions?
* Who do you send it to?
* How many responses would be considered good?

#### Person to Person interview

* Make sure they know you care and this is important to you
* Be very respectful of outsiders' time. 30 minutes.
* Always offer to come to them or make a phone call
* Stick to the time
* Be grateful and offer to return a favor
