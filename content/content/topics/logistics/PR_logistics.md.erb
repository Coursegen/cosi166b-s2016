### Feedback I received
* Felt like they could have done more
* Didn't want to have to chase students

### Engagement
* Ask PRs to send a progress summary email once a week
* How perscriptive to be with the agenda of the meeting?

### Schedule
* Kickoff meeting:
	* Students have defined the projects enough to give a brief presentation
	* Teams have been formed
	* Should happen quite early in the semester
* Interim meetings
	* At least 3
	* Scheduled by me:
		* I know they will happen
		* Hard to get all 4 PRs to agree to the same time
		* A pain when there are conflicts
	* Scheduled by team:
		* I haven't tried that yet
		* Teams might neglect to schedule the meeting on time
		* Can be remediated by grading means
  * Where
    * On Skype
      * Easier for everyone
      * Can be recorded
      * Participation from the whole team can't be ensured
    * Live
      * A little less convenient
      * Also kind of old fashioned
