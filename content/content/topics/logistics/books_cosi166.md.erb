title: Books for Cosi 166b
---
Here are the books that we will be using in this course:
* **Required** [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4): [AWDR\] There are many books out about this topic. This particular one is the most popular and best, although if you want to go deeper I can recommend some others. There will be many readings from this book.
* **Online and free** [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/): [LRHW\] A great online resource for learning to program Ruby quickly.
* **Online and free** [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (3d edition)](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) [RRT\] An excellent complement to [AWDR\]. Covers the same terrian in a totally different way. Cross reference the two.
