title: nT Final Assessments
---
* Quality of the engineering. How is the design, is it broken down into some classes? Is there attention to single responsibility principle? Are the classes and methods reasonably brief. How does the code look? Are there tests and are they being run automatically?
* Quality of the Scalability. How well does the nT perform under load from loader.io? What steps did you take to help it scale better? And what is final result?
* Fit and Finish. Does the final product look professional and clean? Did you read the requirements (from me) broadly and go beyond the very minimum? Or did you just barely get it to work? Does it look good and shoe pride of work?
