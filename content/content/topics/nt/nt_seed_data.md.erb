title: Seed Data
---
#### Why
* To standardize the scalability tests, use this set of seed data
* You can find it here: [Nick's Super Secret Seed Data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3xpzbnns2445wa8/seeds.zip?dl=0)

#### Files
* There are three csv files:
  * user.csv is id,name where user with id has name
  * tweets.csv is id,tweet where user with id posted tweet
  * follows.csv is id1,id2 where user with id1 follows user with id2

#### Content
* There are 1k users.
* Each user has 0-200 tweets (average 100)
* Each user follows (0-10) others
* No user follows itself.
* No two users have the same name.  Tweet text could be repeated.

#### How to use
* This is the bare-bones for required fields
* Each of your schemas will be a little different 
* So you will need to process these files
* Feel free to add any additional fields with Faker.
