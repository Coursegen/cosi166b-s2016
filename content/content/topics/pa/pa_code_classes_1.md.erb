title: Scenes and Points
desc: Leveling assignment for Object Oriented design
---
* We want to represent a simple graphical world of simple two dimensional shapes
* Shapes are:
  * Points, that have an x and y coordinate
  * Rectangles, defined by a point at top-left and a point at bottom-right
  * Circles, defined by a center point and a radius
* Scenes, defined by including zero or more shapes

* Define a class structure for each of those. You may use inheritence if you want.
* The scene class should include methods as follows:
  * constructor
  * add shape
  * delete shape
  * count shapes
* Write a main program that
  * Creates a scene with 2 rectangles and a circle
  * Adds an additional rectangle to the scene
  * Deletes the circle from the scene
  * Prints out a report showing how many shapes of each kind exist in the scene
