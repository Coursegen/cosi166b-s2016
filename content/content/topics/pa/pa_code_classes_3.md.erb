") %>

* We want to represent a rental car fleet, with many different kinds of vehicles:
  * Passenger cars, defined by color and make
  * Trucks, defined by color, make, and capacity
  * Electric Cars, defined color, make, and range in miles
  * The fleet itself, containing some  number of each of those vehicles

* Define a class structure for each of those. You may use inheritance if you want.
  * The fleet class should include methods as follows
    * Constructor
    * Add vehicle
    * Delete vehicle
    * Count total vehicles
    * Find vehicles
