#### Continuation
(click here to go back to <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>)

Continuing from PA Rails 2 we finally add Ajax and Javascript to the search page for a better user experience

#### Part 3: Searching with AJAX and Javascript
1. Modify the search functionality to use AJAX and Javascript such that search results are displayed in the same search page - preferably underneath the search form. 
1. The search results should be updated without reloading the page or rendering a new page.
1. Remove the search/submit button from the search form, and instead add Javascript events on the subject dropdown and course name text field so that results are automatically updated whenever a change is detected in any of the inputs.

###Deliverables:
1. Submit to Latte your link to GitHub.
1. Submit to Latte your link to Heroku.
1. Submit to Latte a zipped up folder of your app.
