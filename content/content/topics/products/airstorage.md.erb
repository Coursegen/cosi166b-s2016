* **Proposer**: Pito Salas

* **Product name**: AirStorage

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Have an empty basement or garage? Looking for a place to store your skis over the weekend? AirStorage connects the dots.

* **Product Summary:**
Many people have basements or garages with some or lots of free space. You might have an empty bay in your three car garage, or a basement with 300 square feet of heated unused storage. What if you could make some extra cash allowing someone else to use that space? This is a service that serves both sides of the transaction: People who need short term storage can search by location, amount and type of space available. And people who have short term storage can describe what they have, where it is, how big it is, whether it has access from the outside, requires stairs and so on. The site brings them together.

* **Elevator pitch:**
