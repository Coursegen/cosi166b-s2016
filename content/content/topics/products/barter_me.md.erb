* **Proposer**: Pito Salas

* **Product name**: BarterMe

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Connect people who have stuff to barter and help them make a deal.

* **Product Summary:** The product creates a marketplace of barterable goods. Users register themselves, and then register goods that they have to barter. They can be books, bicycles, refridgerators, dresses, anything. Then they can search through all the goods and find something of similar value and propose a trade to the other user. The trade is facilitated by the application but the people need to meet in meatspace to actually close the deal.

* **Elevator pitch:** Do you have stuff in your dorm room or basement that you just want to get rid of? Do you like poking around other people's garage sales to see what crap they don't want anymore? What if there was a site where likeminded people could discover and propose trades? You could bundle several of your things and propose a deal against several things that someone else had listed.
