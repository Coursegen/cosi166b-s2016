* **Product name**:
Block Chain X-Ray

* **Tweet length summary of project:**
Educational and Research tool to illuminate the functioning of a world-wide Crypto Currency Block Chain network

* **Product Summary:**
The global block chain network is complicated, highly dynamic and hard to understand. This is an educational and research app which gives a dynamic view into what is going on. Where the miners are, what different copies of the block chain look like, where the bottle necks are and so on. In addition to viewing the actual live block chain network, the app allows researchers to conduct experiments to see the effects of certain changes to the network, the parameters and the protocols.

* **Elevator pitch:**
We're creating an educational and research tool that visualizes how cryptocurrencies in general or bitcoin in particular, work. Showing all the network nodes, simulated users and miners, an animation of all this, including the public ledger. Could serve many purposes, starting with teaching.
