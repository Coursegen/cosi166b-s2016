**Tweet length summary of project:** Select from a database of pre uploaded lens flares, explosions and lasers to make videos appear to be an action film

* **Elevator pitch:** 

* **Product Summary:** Explosify! is an app that is a basic video/image compositor which selects from a database of images and videos of stock footage to be added to short clips that the user uploads. This will let the user produce a photograph, or a short 7 second video.

* **Describe the customer(s):** Vine users, Instagram users, sharers of multimedia and content creators, in order who are interested in adding special effects. There is a host of applications that are image manipulators, but this would cater towards a social media niche user base, like instagram or vine. 

* **Customer Pains/Gains:**: describe what problems the product will eliminate for the customer

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:**It creates a basic profile for a user, which includes the list of videos that they have produced

* **Personal statment:** As a filmmaker and self-professed avid social media junky, I think this would be a fun project to work on, and would be a nifty and niche application for people who would like to have an application, as well as to make sharing compatible
