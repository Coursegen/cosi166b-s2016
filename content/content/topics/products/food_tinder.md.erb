* **Proposer:** Artem Malyshev

* **Product Name:** Tinder for food/restaurants/bars

* **Tweet Summary:** People often can't choose where to order from or what to order. This web app allows users to upload pictures of food or the restaurant interior to help other people decide. The pictures will be presented like in Tinder where a user can flip through them

* **Product Summary:**  This service will let users submit pictures of interiors of restaurants, bars and food. The user will flip through them and if he likes certain pictures they will be stored for him to review later. The liked pictures will offer links to yelp and other similar services.

Furthermore the user will be able to switch to a mapped view where certain areas where user activity is concentrated will be highlighted more (solving the problem of which area of the city to go for restaurants, etc.). Concentration will be determined by amount of photos posted from that area. 

Also there is an idea of adding profiles for the user. So if the user posts pictures and other users like them enough he will have an "expert" status meaning he recommends good restaurants and people would like to follow him.

* **Personal Statement:** I have personally have faced issues of where to order from or where to eat out on the weekends, and Yelp reviews are not very descriptive as to the interior of the restaurants. Furthermore, pictures uploaded to Yelp are usually poor quality and few in number. 

* **Design:** The design probably would resemble the Tinder: a swiping structure, with options to narrow search by allowing options (i.e., bar, restaurants or food to order).

From what I understand, we are building more of a desktop application and this idea is geared to a mobile version. But I think with ruby on rails we can build a native looking web app for mobile phones and a desktop version.
