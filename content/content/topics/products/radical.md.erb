* **Proposer**: Phill Skokos

* **Product name**: Radical

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Craigslist for creatives

* **Product Summary:** Thought craigslist already has a section for creative aspects, this is for specifically creatives, and allows more freedom and customization, as well as real time updated gigs, events, and calls for talent

* **Elevator pitch:** 

* **Describe the customer(s):** Creatives and artists from theater to video to film and visual art. As technology and art is becoming more integrated, it becomes more necessary to develop, maintain, and foster connections in the art world.

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:** It creates a basic profile for a user, and allows them to get in contact with other creatives in their field, and other closely related fields. 

* **Customer Pains/Gains:** \[describe what problems the product will eliminate for the customer\]

* **Personal statment:** As someone who works in film, with friends in other fields such as music, theater, and art, I think it would good to have a program that would be useful towards people all these fields, in order to connect them, as well as to keep track of the connections that they make on the job, not to mention post gigs. This is different from sites like linked in, because this can be used from the amateur filmmaker, actor, and casual hobbyist to official businesses.
