* **Proposer**: Pito Salas

* **Product name**: TBD

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Dip into the stream of social media to do quantitative research

* **Product Summary:** This product could be used in many different highly specific contexts. So let me pick just one to illustrate. Let's say a venture capitalist wants to discover entrepreneurs who are going to be looking for funding, even before they do. Starting from certain "seed" individuals, we could monitor postings on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook or others, looking for posts that talk about funding, or product planning, or other recent fundings, any of which might indicate that they are starting to think about this. We could discover individuals and give them some kind of score based on their likelyhood based on evidence from different sources.

* **Elevator pitch:**

* **Describe the customer(s):**

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:**

* **Customer Pains/Gains:** \[describe what problems the product will eliminate for the customer\]
