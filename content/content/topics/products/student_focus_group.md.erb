* **Product Summary:** 
Develop a huge, diverse panel of students who are willing to answer a focus group kind of question, for example, "How many cups of coffee do you drink each day.", or "How much would you pay for streaming access to NFL games from your dorm room". Businesses who want to pose questions, based on geography, gender, age, or whatever, pay a fee to the business. That fee is used to compensate the students based on some magic formula. Panel members recruit new panel members to grow the panels from campus to campus.
