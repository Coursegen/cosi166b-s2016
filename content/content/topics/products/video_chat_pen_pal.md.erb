* **Proposer:** Yoseph Kantorovich

* **Product name:** Video chat pen pal

* **Tweet length summary of project:** Practicing languages with native speakers

* **Product Summary:** What does someone learning a language have in common with the native speaker of the language? Those people also want to improve and learn English. Practice your foreign language speaking skills by videochatting "omegle style" with people from other countries.

* **Describe the customer(s):** This would be a great product for any foreign language teacher or student looking to quickly improve their speaking ability. This could also be a great tool to prepare to go studying abroad.

* **Describe what “jobs” the product will do for the customer:** Since speaking a language is the best way to learn it, this would provide simple topics and prompts for students to converse in both English and the foreign language. It would match you up with someone who is fluent in your language and is looking to learn english. Another option would be just to match up with someone looking to learn your language and be able to practice it together.

* **Money:** This could be sold to foreign language classrooms as a very handy tool for teachers to use.

* **Personal statement:** As someone who loves to go abroad and interact with different cultures I think it would be really cool to build a videochat where you can connect with people of specific countries and be able to interact with them while improving your mastery of their language.

* **Design:** The design would be similar to omegle.com where you could write in the name of the language you want to practice and connect to a native speaker or someone else who is learning your language.
