* **Product Summary:** 
I don't know if this makes any sense because I don't know how rooms are assigned exactly...

But what if you could rate your dorm room - location, condition, things that work or are broken, convenience to classes, condition of the bathrooms whatever. Then, when you are deciding what room or building to go for you have some basis for doing that. 

Also it could then become a source of info for knowing what rooms need to be repaired or rehabbed or whatever.
