* ['Sandy Metz' Rules](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)
  * Classes can be no longer than 100 lines of code
  * Methods can be no longer than five lines of code
  * Pass no more than four parameters into a method
  * Controllers (Rails) can insantiate only one object. Therefore views can only know about one instance variable, and only send methods to that object. (@view_presenter.user.username is not allowed)
