title: Choosing a project to work on
---
* Be hard-nosed! Don't go for what looks fun and cool ONLY
* Challenge yourself and your teammates
* Do a little research using your common sense!
* Can you find other similar products, competitors, or related products, and is this a good or bad thing?
* Look in Kickstarter and RocketHub. Are there any related projects?
* Do you believe that you could actually get enough funding through Kickstarter or RocketHub to build a prototype?
* What would the Sharktank say of it?
* How big a real problem is this really solving?
* For who, and do you think those people would be willing to pay for it?
* How would you get it to them?
* What kind of price do you think they would be willing to pay?
* Are you pretty sure this can be productized (that is, not can we make a single one by hand, but can we make a lot of them?)
