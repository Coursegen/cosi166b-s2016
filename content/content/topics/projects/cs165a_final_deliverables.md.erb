title: Term Project Final Deliverables
---

#### Summary

This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome!

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The important things are the journey, the process, and what you learned that will help you be a better entrepreneur.

#### Final Presentation Day

On Friday December 11, from 10:00am to 12:00pm we will have final presentations. Several Product Reviewers (tm) will be invited to listen to each team do their presentations, ask questions, and have one on one conversations while we munch on snacks and drink delicious beverages.

The PRs will ask to review the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. Their review will be based on the formal presentation. But your grade will be based on that plus the the additional deliverables described below.

##### What PRs will be looking for

* A strong problem statement. What can be improved in the way things work today?
* A clear explanation of what the product or business idea is
* An explanation of how this product or business fixes the stated problem and "why now?"
* Empirical information ("getting out of the building") supporting the project -- talking to people, surveys, looking at other products or web  sites, data from studies that might be relevant
* A discussion of the business and growth model, e.g. How do you plan to make money, how you will drive growth, how much funding you think you will need, etc.

**Not an outline!** Note that the above is not an outline. You can structure your presentation along the lines that Bill Wittenberg suggested, or you could structure it along the lines of the <%= link_to_topic :business_model_canvas %>, or you can do something different.") %>
