title: Project Web Site
---
#### What is it
For every project, part of the final deliverables is a project web site. This can be a (long) single page web site, including text and graphics, that explains the story of the project. When I say single page web site, it would be a long single page.

It should include the team, background, the vision, mockups, prototypes or working product, story of false starts and discoveries, pointers to git repositories, and anything else that tells the story.

It doesn't have to be flashy, but it should be professional, clean, businesslike. And don't worry only about the graphics, think about the content. It should be well organized and structured with good english, and not too many words.

#### Examples
Here are some sites that might serve as inspiration for the kind of thing we are talking about here:

* [Falkor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/)

#### Where to create it
<%= callout("NB:", " Create it on a server which will survive from semester to semester and even after graduation") %>
Possibilities are:

  * a Single page static web site on Github. This is convenient because you can use the same github account that contains your code. Read all about it here: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
  * A similar option exists for Dropbox. They too will let you host a free web site there. In the case of dropbox, you have to be working directly in html etc. Of course you can use any theme you want. Read all about it here: [DropBox Static Web Page](http://alexcican.com/post/guide-hosting-website-dropbox-github/)
  * Finally, you can try to use Weebly. It is a bit fancier, free web site hosting service. For simple cases like yours you can get away totally free, which is great. [Info about Weebly Free Services](http://www.weebly.com/home/)

#### Important
*This is not a web site to sell stuff or market stuff, it is a project report site. Keep it simple. Keep it elegant. Try to keep it to one page, it's clean.*
