#### Cookies are the crux of sessions
* Max 4K of data, stored as 'file' by the browser on YOUR laptop
* Each HTTP GET can potentially store a cookie:
  * `curl -I http://www.google.com | grep Set-Cookie`
* Browser will send that cookie back whenever:
	* it is sending a request to the same server
	* the cookie has not expired
* But really, all you need is a 'fact' that the server gives to the client which is later on played back, e.g.
  * `http://www.salas.com?SESSION=FFAF00AFFAF00AFFAF00AF`
