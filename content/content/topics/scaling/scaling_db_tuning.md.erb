### Scalability Pattern: Database Tuning
* Considering the code
  * Minimize the number of times code calls the database (which is usually the same as the number of SQL statements are sent.)
  * Check whether there is a bulk operations which will do the job (e.g inserting ten records with one call)
* Consider the Schema
  * Are the right columns indexed? Either too many or too few can be bad for performance, depending on the scenario.
  * Check whether there are database constraints that you can add
  * Check whether there are stored procedures that could be useful
* Database Administrator
  * A separate technical title, usually highly paid and highly specialized
