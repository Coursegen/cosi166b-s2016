#### Experimental Computer Science?
* We have many many beliefs (or debates) (in engineering and computer science) which are not based on evidence, for example: 
  * Are static or dynamic types more productive? 
  * Are 2 or 4 week sprints better? 
  * Is deeply commented code more maintainable? 
  * Are languages with 2 dimensional arrays better? 
  * Does multiple-inheritence reduce programmer productivity?
  * Is there a 100:1 productivity ratio between the best and worse programmers?
